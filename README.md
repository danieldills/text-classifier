## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the [Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/) tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.

## Implementation Notes

- You are only required to build the Baseline Model.
- Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
- Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
- Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.

## Setup

- Create a ```text-classifier``` repository on GitHub
- Name notebook ```text_classifier.ipynb```

## Testing

- No automated testing requirements for this lab.
